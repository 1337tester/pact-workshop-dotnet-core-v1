# Example .NET Core Project for Pact Workshop

When writing a lot of small services, testing the interactions between these becomes a major headache.
That's the problem Pact is trying to solve.

Integration tests typically are slow and brittle, requiring each component to have its own environment to run the tests in.
With a micro-service architecture, this becomes even more of a problem. They also have to be 'all-knowing' and this makes them
difficult to keep from being fragile.

After J. B. Rainsberger's talk [Integrated Tests Are A Scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfX44fZoMc) people have been thinking
how to get the confidence we need to deploy our software to production without having a tiresome integration test suite that does
not give us all the coverage we think it does.

PactNet is a .NET implementation of Pact that allows you to define a pact between service consumers and providers. It provides a DSL for
service consumers to define the request they will make to a service producer and the response they expect back. This expectation is
used in the consumer's specs to provide a mock producer and is also played back in the producer specs to ensure the producer actually
does provide the response that the consumer expects.

This allows you to test both sides of an integration point using fast unit tests.

# Prerequisites

This workshop while written with .NET Core is not specifically about it so in-depth knowledge of .NET Core is not required if you can
write code in any other language you should be fine.

However before taking part in this workshop please make sure you have:

* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/)
* An account at [Github.com](www.github.com)!
* A text editor/IDE that supports .NET Core. Check out [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
